# AdvantageScope Lite for FTC

AdvantageScope is a robot diagnostics, log review/analysis,
and data visualization application for FIRST teams developed by Team 6328.
It reads logs in WPILOG, DS log, Hoot (CTRE), Road Runner, CSV, and RLOG file formats,
plus live robot data viewing using NT4, Phoenix, RLOG, or FTC Dashboard streaming.

AdvantageScope includes the following tools:

- A wide selection of flexible graphs and charts
- 2D and 3D field visualizations of pose data, with customizable CAD-based robots
- Synchronized video playback from a separately loaded match video
- Joystick visualization, showing driver actions on customizable controller representations
- Swerve drive module vector displays
- Console message review
- Log statistics analysis
- Flexible export options, with support for CSV and WPILOG

AdvantageScope Lite for FTC allows you to install AdvantageScope directly on your FTC robot,
for convenient live viewing and log replay.
It has plug and play support for any library that uses FTC Dashboard for live view, such as Road Runner and Pedro Pathing.
For match replays, it has instant support for viewing Road Runner and PsiKit logs, including from before you installed AdvantageScope!
